# Playlist.AI Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the Playlist.AI application architecture, its components, and how they interact.

## System Architecture

Playlist.AI follows a client-server architecture with the following main components:

1. **Mobile Application (Client)**
   - React Native cross-platform app for iOS and Android
   - Handles user input and playlist display
   - Communicates with backend services via REST API

2. **Backend Service (Server)**
   - FastAPI Python application
   - Manages business logic and data processing
   - Communicates with external APIs (OpenAI, YouTube)
   - Handles user authentication and data storage

3. **Database System**
   - PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
   - Stores user information, preferences, and playlist history

4. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis for caching frequently accessed data
   - Stores temporary data for performance optimization

5. **Task Queue System**
   - Celery for handling asynchronous and time-consuming tasks
   - Manages playlist generation processes in the background

## Data Flow

1. **Playlist Generation Flow**
   - User submits playlist request through mobile app
   - Request is validated and queued for processing
   - OpenAI API processes the prompt to generate search queries
   - YouTube API searches for videos matching the queries
   - System creates a playlist on YouTube
   - User is notified when the playlist is ready

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - User registers or logs in through the mobile app
   - Backend validates credentials and issues JWT token
   - Token is stored securely on the device
   - Subsequent requests include the token for authentication

## API Integration

### OpenAI API
- Used for processing and expanding user prompts
- Converts simple descriptions into optimized search queries
- Handles natural language understanding for better content matching

### YouTube API
- Searches for videos based on expanded queries
- Creates playlists in the Playlist.AI YouTube account
- Handles collaboration permissions for user access

## Deployment Architecture

The application is deployed using containerization for consistent environments:

- Docker containers for backend services
- Container orchestration for scaling and management
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Security Considerations

- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- HTTPS for all communications
- Environment-based API key management
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Application performance monitoring
- User engagement analytics
- Error tracking and logging
- Feature usage statistics

## Future Expansion

The architecture is designed to accommodate future features:

- Additional AI models for playlist curation
- Support for more content platforms beyond YouTube
- Advanced recommendation algorithms
- User collaborative features
